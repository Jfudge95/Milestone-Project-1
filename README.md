Welcome to Bakery Bounce




Background: Bakery Bounce is a game developed by myself for my coding Bootcamp. This game is to show my front-end abilities through HTML, CSS, and Javascript. What better way than a hamster baker bouncing on cartoon loaves of bread!



Instructions:Use your left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to move Chef Hamster. The more loaves of bread you climb without falling, the higher your score. Most importantly Have Fun!
